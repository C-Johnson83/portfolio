                    Hello there! I'm Chris Johnson, and I an avid RPG gamer, and there's something magical about
                    immersing myself in virtual worlds, embarking on epic quests, and conquering dragons and beasts, or
                    maybe just saving the day.

                    When I'm not in the gaming realm, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with
                    ingredients and flavors. Cooking is my canvas, and the dishes I create are my works of art (or maybe
                    a kit I got from Home Chef, but who knows).

                    Anime has a special place in my heart, with its unique stories, vibrant characters, and
                    thought-provoking themes. It's a world I love to explore, one episode at a time. My favorite show is
                    One Piece. I have been watching it for almost 20 years now!</br></br>


                    In the real world, I'm a proud parent to two wonderful kids â€“ a 12 year old son who is first chair
                    on the trumpet, and an eleven year old daughter who is an aspiring computer scientist. They bring
                    endless joy and adventures into my life. I'm also the head of a lively household that includes three
                    dogs and two cats, making every day an exciting journey.<br>

                </p>
                <p>Professionally, I've ventured into the world of coding with VBA, thanks to my experience with Excel
                    at work. It didn't take long for me to become proficient, and I've developed several Excel tools
                    that streamline our daily tasks, making work life a little easier for everyone.

                    This newfound passion led me to pursue a six-month data analytics bootcamp at the University of
                    Minnesota, where I excelled with a 102 average. I've discovered the thrill of deciphering data and
                    drawing meaningful insights from it.        I'm also eagerly looking ahead to the exciting world of web design. Crafting digital experiences and
                    bringing ideas to life through web design is a creative journey I can't wait to embark on. Check out some of my work below</p>
